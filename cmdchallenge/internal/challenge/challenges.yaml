    You've stumbled upon a festive adventure where you need to type single commands into your browser to get Christmas presents!
    As a reward for your efforts, you might learn a little bit about the command line.

    On just about every Unix and Unix-like operating systems there is a command named `ls`. <br />
    `ls` is short for "list" and can be used to list files in your current working directory.

    Try sending the command `ls` in the command box to list all files in the directory.
  disp_learn: true
  example: ls

    _Hint: look for lines that contain the string "laugh"_<br /><br />
    _If you aren't sure what to do, expand the "learn" section above._<br />

    What's so funny? Let's look for lines in our Christmas poem that are laughing.

    `grep` is the most common command-line utility for extracting text from a file.<br />
    The syntax of the command is `grep PATTERN <file>`.<br />
    `PATTERN` is a string, and refers to a [basic regular expression](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/BRE-syntax.html).<br />
    All you need to know for now is to set `PATTERN` to the string you are looking for.

    In this example you might try:

    ```
    grep laugh night-before-christmas.txt
    ```

    Which will print every single line that contains the string "laugh".<br />
    There are many options for the `grep` command, for example to do a case-insensitive search you would type:

    ```
    grep -i laugh night-before-christmas.txt
    ```

    To see all available options check out the man page by sending the command `man grep` or the help `grep --help`.

  example: grep laugh night-before-christmas.txt
  expected_output:
    lines:
      - That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.
      - And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;

  learn: |
    When you have a text file, it's common to only need to see the top N lines.
    Included in most Unix-like systems is a utility named `head`.
    By default, it will display the first 10 lines of the file.

    To display the first 3 lines, you will need to use the option `-n 3`.

    Try sending the command:

    ```
    head -n 3 night-before-christmas.txt
    ```

  example: head -3 night-before-christmas.txt
  expected_output:
    lines:

    Just like we needed to look at the beginning lines on day three, a utility called `tail` can be used to look at the bottom N lines.
    By default it will display the last 10 lines so like before you will need to use the `-n` option.

    ```
    tail -n 4 night-before-christmas.txt
    ```
  example: tail -4 night-before-christmas.txt
  expected_output:

    </div>
  learn: |
    We already used `grep` to extract a string from a file earlier so if you were thinking we would use `grep` again you are on the right track!

    Here we want to find all lines that start with the word "the".
    One way you could do this is look for a capital "T" since the beginning of every sentence is capatilized.<br />
    Since `grep` is case sensitive by default, one way would be to search for the string `The`

    We mentioned early that the PATTERN in `grep PATTERN <file>` refers to a [basic regular expression](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/BRE-syntax.html).<br />
    This allows to do more than simple string matches by using the basic regular expression syntax.<br />
    One example is the `^` character which will anchor the search to the start of every string.<br />
    This type of character is called a [regex anchor](https://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html).<br />

    To do a case-insenstive search for the word `the` but only match it at the _beginning_ of every line, you will need to use a combination of `-i` for case insenstive match and an `^` anchor.

    For example:

    ```
    grep -i "^the" night-before-christmas.txt
    ```

    Try it below!
  example: grep -i "^the" night-before-christmas.txt
  expected_output:
    lines:
      - The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
      - The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
      - The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
      - The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

    Six lines that are exciting! ...
    </div>

    ---
    _Hint: Exciting lines end with "!"_
  learn: |
    To find "exciting" lines we want to only print lines that end with a `!` character.<br />
    Just like how previously we learned that regular expression syntax can match strings with an anchor at the beginning of the line we can use `$` to anchor the match at the end.

    ```
    grep '!$' night-before-christmas.txt
    ```

    One important thing to be aware of is that the character `!` is a [special character](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/1565923472/ch01s09.html) for the shell.<br />
    To ensure that this works correctly you will need to either use single-quotes like above, or escape it with a `\`:

    ```
    grep \!$ night-before-christmas.txt
    ```
  example: grep \!$ night-before-christmas.txt
  expected_output:

    </div>
  learn: |
    Now there are more than just one file in the working directory. Like the first day, we will need to use the `ls` command to list them.<br />
    Unlike before, we need to limit the output to only files that begin with the string "Santa".<br />
    To do this, we will need to use a feature of most shells that is called wildcarding or [globbing](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/globbingref.html).

    To create a wildcard, you will use the `*` character which will match zero or more characters after the string.<br />
    For example, to match anything that starts with the string "Santa" you will need to send:

    ```
    ls Santa*
    ```

    If you wanted to list files that start with "Santa" or "santa" there is another feature you can use that can match multiple characters called [ranges](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_04_03.html).<br />
    For example:

    ```
    ls [Ss]anta*
    ```

    Will match both files named `Santa's hat` and `santa's toys`.
  example: ls -1  [Ss]anta*
  expected_output:

    ---
    _Hint: Try finding files named after Elves and moving them to the Workshop/ directory._
  learn: |
    The elves are lost and only you can help them get back into Santa's workshop!

    You can see where they are by sending the command `ls Elves/`. This will list all the files in the "Elves/" directory.
    To move them to the `Workhop/` we will need to use the `mv` command and the `*` wildcard that was used on Day 7.

    The `mv` command will move one more more files from one location to a new one. <br />
    If you specify multiple files, all the files will be moved to the last argument which is the destination.

    For example:

    ```
    mv file1 file2 file3 destination/
    ```
    Will move all three files to the folder named `destination/`

    To move every file in in `Elves/` we can use a wildcard `Elves/*`, and move them by sending the following command:

    ```
    mv Elves/* Workshop/
    ```
  example: mv Elves/* Workshop/

  learn: |
    Santa's nine Reindeer are lost in sub-directories, can you find them?

    Here we introduce a common utility called `find` which as you can probably guess, is
    used to find files. The Reindeer are hiding in sub-directories, to search for them
    in the current directory we use `.` as the first option to `find`. `.` is just another
    way of specifying the current working directory that you are in.

    Try sending:

    ```
    find .
    ```

    This will find both directories **and** files which is not what we want. <br />
    In order to display only files, you will need to use the `-type f` argument to `find`:

    ```
    find . -type f
    ```
  example: find . -type f

    The Ten Lords are all mixed up!

    Sorting is something we do often on the command line.
    There is a file named `lords.txt` that contains a list of lords. We can
    use the command `sort` to sort the contents and print them, by default
    it will sort the file in dictionary order.

  learn: |
    The pipers are playing their pipes but also other music, can you print the piping music?

    Here we find ourselves in a directory with files named `piper`, each file
    with one line matching the string "♫ piping ♫". <br />
    To only output the lines that match "♫ piping ♫" we will need to first find
    the files that contain the string, and then output their contents.

    Earlier we used the `find` command to find files, here we will use it again to
    find files named `piper`:

    ```
    find . -name "piper" -type f
    ```

    To look for specific strings in each `find` result, the `-exec` can be used to execute a
    command for every file found. The special string `{}` can be used as a substitute for the
    filename. For example:

    ```
    find . -name "piper" -type f -exec grep piping {} \;
    ```

    will search for the string "piping" and execute `grep` in every file that find returns.
    The `\;` is an escaped `;` that ends the command that is executed.

    There are a lot of different ways to get the same result, see the solutions for more examples.
    It's even possible to play the pipers piping using a pipe!
  example: find . -name "piper" -exec grep piping {} \;

    In the future
    Environmental destruction will be the norm
    No longer can it be said that
    My peers and I care about this earth
    It will be evident that

    It is foolish to presume that
