On the twelfth day of Shell my true love gave to me
Twelve days of Shell on the terminal
Eleven lines with pipers ♫ piping ♫
Ten lords by their names sorted
Nine names of Santa's reindeer
Eight elves in Santa's Workhop/
Seven files that start with "Santa"
Six lines that are exciting!
Five lines that start with "the"
Four lines at the end
Three lines at the beginning
Two lines a-laughing
And a list of files in the directory tree
