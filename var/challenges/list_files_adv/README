# List Files Adv
# **************

# List all of the files in the current directory, display a slash (`/') immediately after
# each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk (`*') after each that is executable,
# an at sign (`@') after each symbolic link. Output one file per line.
# Hint: directories are suffixed with '/', executables with '*'.
# You will need to restrict the number of columns too.
