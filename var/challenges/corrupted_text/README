# She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe.
# Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation
# and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have
# faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to
# perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous
# and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill
# his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which
# has become more terrible than ever in the person of this
# murderer and villain!
