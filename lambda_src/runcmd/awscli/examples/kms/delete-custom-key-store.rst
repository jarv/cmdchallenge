**To delete a custom key store**

The following ``delete-custom-key-store`` example deletes the specified custom key store. This command doesn't have any effect on the associated CloudHSM cluster.

**NOTE:** Before you can delete a custom key store, you must schedule the deletion of all CMKs in the custom key store and then wait for those CMKs to be deleted. Then, you must disconnect the custom key store. ::

    delete-custom-key-store \
        --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0

This command does not return any output. To verify that the custom key store is deleted, use the ``describe-custom-key-stores`` command.
